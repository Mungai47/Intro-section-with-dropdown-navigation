## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap (v5.3.1)
- Responsive Design Principles

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to create a responsive webpage using Bootstrap and CSS. I gained a better understanding of media queries, flexbox, and CSS grid for different screen sizes. I also learned how to use Bootstrap's components for navigation bars and buttons.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and explore more advanced features of Bootstrap. I also want to focus on enhancing my understanding of JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to my projects.
